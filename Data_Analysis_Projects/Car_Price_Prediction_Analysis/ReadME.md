# Car Price Prediction Analysis
The data that we are going to use in this project is about cars. Specifically containing various information datapoints about the used cars, like their price, color, etc. Here simply collecting data isn’t enough.
**Raw** data isn’t useful. Here data analysis plays a vital role in unlocking the information that we require and to gain new insights into this raw data.Consider this scenario, one of our friends, wants to sell 
his car. But he doesn’t know how much should he sell his car for! He wants to maximize the profit but he also wants it to be sold for a reasonable price for someone who would want to own it.Let’s think like data
scientists and clearly define some of his problems: For example, is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics? What features of cars affect their prices? Colour? Brand? Does horsepower also 
affect the selling price, or perhaps, something else? To answer these questions, we’re going to need some data. But this data is in raw form. Hence we need to analyze it first. The data is available in the form of 
.csv/.data format and its provided in this project (**'output.csv'**).
