# Zomato Data Analysis
Python and its following libraries are used to analyze Zomato data.
<ol>
    <li> Numpy– With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently. </li>
    <li> Matplotlib– It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more. </li>
    <li> Pandas– The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation. </li>
    <li> Seaborn– It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. </li>
</ol>
We use Jupyter Notebook to simplify our task.

To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:
<ol>
    <li> Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services? </li>
    <li> Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public? </li>
    <li> What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants? </li>
</ol>
